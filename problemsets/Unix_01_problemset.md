### Try these examples

**The files you need later in this review are in our [github repository](https://github.com/prog4biol/pfb2024). There will be direction on how to retrieve them**

Let's go to a directory with a lot of files in it and list those files

```bash
cd /bin/
ls
```

__What's the difference between these two commands?__

Try them both!!
```
ls -l
ls -lt
```


__Pipes__ 

You can string more than one command together with a pipe `|` , such that the standard output of the first command is 'piped' into the standard input of the second command.

Try it!!
```
ls -lt | head
```



__Semicolons__

You can string more than one command together by putting a semi-colon `;` after the each command. Here, the commands will be run sequentially, but any output does not get passed from one command to the next.

Try it!!
```
date ; sleep 2 ; date
```
> If you want to know more about `sleep` type `man sleep`


__Download a file__. 

Change directory to your home directory. You likely have permissions to write to your home directory. Now use `curl` to download files. On some systems only one of these may be available

```
cd ~

curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prog4biol/pfb2024/master/files/cuffdiff.txt
```
Note '-O' is the letter O not the number Zero 0

__Redirect STDOUT__  
You can redirect the output of a command into a file. 
```
cd ~
grep Chr7 cuffdiff.txt > fav_chr_cuffdiff.txt
```



__Append STDOUT to the end of a file that already exists__

You can append the output of a command to a file

```
grep Chr9 cuffdiff.txt >> fav_chr_cuffdiff.txt
```



__Redirect STDERR__  

You can redirect STDERR to a file.

Let's review what STDERR actually is.
```
cat blablabla.txt
```
> file blablabla.txt does not exist so we get `cat: blablabla.txt: No such file or directory` printed to the terminal. This message is labeled by the operating system as an error message or STDERR. 

STDERR is a labeled type of output we can redirect

```
cat blablabla.txt 2> errors.txt
```
> We can redirect the error messages, A.K.A. STDERR, to a new file called anything we want


What happens when you try to redirect STDOUT?
```
cat blablabla.txt > errors.txt
```
> `cat: blablabla.txt: No such file or directory` still gets printed to the screen because we only redirect STDOUT to our file. There is no STDOUT in this case and our file will be empty. How would you verify this?




__Redirect STDOUT and STDERR__

You can redirect both STDOUT and STDERR to **two separate** files in one command.

```
# just print it to the terminal first
cat fav_chr_cuffdiff.txt blablabla.file

# redirect to two files, STDOUT to out.txt, STDERR to err.txt 
cat fav_chr_cuffdiff.txt blablabla.file 1> out.txt 2> err.txt

# this does the same, do you see the difference?
cat fav_chr_cuffdiff.txt blablabla.file > out.txt 2> err.txt


```
> Examine the contents of `out.txt` and `err.txt`. REMEMBER you can use your text editor to open and look at the contents of any file. A text file can have any extention that you want it to have. It does not have to end in .txt, it can be .fa .fasta .nt .trash .anything .nothing

You can also redirect both STDOUT and STDERR to **the same** file.
```
cat fav_chr_cuffdiff.txt blablabla.file &> all_out_err.txt 
```
> Check out what is in the `all_out_err.txt`

Problem Set
===========

1. Log into your machine. 

2. What is the full path to your home directory?

3. Go up one directory?
    - How many files does it contain?
    - How many directories?

4. Make a directory called `PFB_problemsets` in your home directory.

5. Navigate into this new directory called problemsets. Verify that you are in the correct directory by using `pwd`.

6. Use `curl -O` to copy <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prog4biol/pfb2024/master/files/sequences.nt.fa> from the web into your problemsets directory. If `curl` is not available on your system, use `wget` as an alternative. (Note '-O' is the letter O not the number Zero 0)

7. Without using a text editor, use unix commands to find these qualities for the file `sequences.nt.fa`.
  This file can be found here <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prog4biol/pfb2024/master/files/sequences.nt.fa>
      - How many lines does this file contain?   
      - How many characters?    (Hint: check out the options of wc)
      - What is the first line of this file?    (Hint: read the man page of head)
      - What are the last 3 lines?    (Hint: read the man page of tail)
      - How many sequences are in the file?    (Hint: use grep) (Note: The start of a sequence is indicated by a `>` character.)    

8. Rename `sequences.nt.fa` to `cancer_genes.fasta`. (Hint: read the man page for mv)

9. If you haven't already, copy/download this remote file, cuffdiff.txt, to your problemset directory using `curl`. Here is the url you can use: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prog4biol/pfb2024/master/files/cuffdiff.txt>. Use `-O` is the letter O not the number zero 0.



10. Do the following to `cuffdiff.txt`. The descriptions of each column in the file are in the table below.
    - Look at the first few lines of the file
    - Sort the file by log fold change 'log2(fold_change)', from highest to lowest, and save in a new file in your directory called sorted.cuffdiff.out
    - Sort the file (log fold change highest to lowest) then print out only the first 100 lines. Save in a file called `top100.sorted.cuffdiff.out`.
    - Sort the file by log fold change, print out the top 100, print only first column. This will be a list of the top 100 genes with the largest change in expression. Make sure your list is sorted by gene name and is unique. Save this curated list in a file called `differentially.expressed.genes.txt`.



__Cuffdiff file format__

| 6             | sample 2          | Brain                | Label (or number if no labels provided) of the second sample being tested |
| 7             | Test status       | NOTEST               | Can be one of OK (test successful), NOTEST (not enough alignments for testing), LOWDATA (too complex or shallowly sequenced), HIDATA (too many fragments in locus), or FAIL,  when an ill-conditioned covariance matrix or other numerical exception prevents testing. |
| 8             | FPKMx             | 8.01089              | FPKM of the gene in sample x             |

| 11            | test stat         | 0.860902             | The value of the test statistic used to compute significance of the observed change in FPKM |
| 12            | p value           | 0.389292             | The uncorrected p-value of the test statistic |
| 13            | q value           | 0.985216             | The FDR-adjusted p-value of the test statistic |
| 14            | significant       | no                   | Can be either "yes" or "no", depending on whether p is greater then the FDR after Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple-testing |
